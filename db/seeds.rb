# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# u = User.new(username: "Matantan", password: "password", fname: "Edward", lname: "Trinidad", birthday: "1990-05-04", gender: "M", location: 10032 )
